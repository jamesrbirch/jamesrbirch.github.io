# My Journey in Engineering

## Building Value-Driven Products and Empowering Teams

Hello, I'm James Birch. For over 15 years, I have built my career in the technology sector, evolving from a hands-on software engineer to a leader of dynamic, product-focused teams. My passion lies in the space where a deep understanding of user needs informs the creation of truly valuable and reliable software.

While much of my experience has been in the Ed-Tech sector, where I was proud to contribute to products with a positive social impact, the core of my work is universal: solving complex problems through technology. A defining period of my career was an eight-year journey leading two core SaaS products from concept to maturity. This experience taught me that success is not just about elegant code; it's about deeply understanding the user's world and building something they can depend on. Seeing our work translate into significant revenue and lasting customer loyalty cemented my belief in a value-driven development culture.

## My Approach to Leadership

I believe great products are built by empowered teams who feel a sense of ownership and purpose. My leadership style is centred on:

- Clarity and Alignment: Ensuring every team member understands our 'why'—the customer problem we are solving.
- Mentorship and Growth: Fostering an environment where developers can build their skills and advance their careers.
- Agile for Value: Using agile methodologies not as a rigid process, but as a tool to maintain tight feedback loops and deliver value incrementally.

## Technical Foundations

To build products that customers trust, you need a bedrock of technical excellence. My background provides a strong technical command across the full product lifecycle, from architecture to deployment. This includes:

- Core Languages & Frameworks: C#, TypeScript, SQL, and the .NET/ASP.NET ecosystem.
- Infrastructure & Deployment: Expertise in designing, deploying, and managing solutions on both Microsoft Azure and self-hosted web platforms.
- Process & Automation: A strong focus on building and maintaining robust CI/CD pipelines to ensure quality and release velocity.

This technical foundation allows me to guide high-level architectural decisions and ensure we are building for the long term.

## Looking Ahead

The principles of building robust, user-centric products and fostering collaborative teams are applicable everywhere. I am keen to apply my experience to new challenges and am open to opportunities in any sector where technology is used to solve meaningful problems.
