## Getting started

Create a new project
Make sure node 18+ is installed.

```shell
npm create svelte@latest
```

At the prompt select:

- `Skeleton project`
- `Typescript syntax`
- We can then select the option to install Eslint, Prettier, Playwrite and Vite.

Install the dependancies:

```shell
npm i
```

To run the application

```shell
npm run dev
```

## Application Structure

`vite.config.ts` contains the build configuration
`svelte.config.ts` contains the svelte configuration, this can be extended to deploy to numerous different environments.
`static` contains all the static assets for the project such as images, fonts and other assets.
`src` containst the source

The start page of the project is `app.html`

In the `src` folder create a `lib` folder, this will be accesible using the shorthand `$lib` through the application. We can place components and utilities in the folder and have a shorthand way to reference them.

## Extensions

Install the Svelte for VS Code extension. This has the ability to generate boiler plate pages, right click on a folder to access it though the context menu or bring up the command pallete and type `sveltekit`

##Â Routes

Sveltekit uses folder based routing, the url is determined by the folder structure.

Folders can be be:

- static - `hello` would route to `www.mysite.com/hello`
- dynamic - `[username]` svelte sees the variable `username` as a route parameter. We could use the code `params.username = 'Bob'` and Svelte would have the url route to `www.mysite.com/bob`

## Page Types

There are 4 types of files in svelte and each of these files can end with `.svelte`, `.server.ts` and `.ts`.

By default the first page load is rendered on the server, any navigation or updates after that will be handled by the client.
